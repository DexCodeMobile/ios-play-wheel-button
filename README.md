# Play Wheel Button

## Description

The first project involves making an app that displays a wheel in the middle of the screen, with a button at the top of the wheel. The button should show its position on the wheel in degrees (0-360), and the user should be able to drag it around the wheel. When the user drags the button, the button's value should update to display its new position on the wheel. Pressing the button should cause it to rotate around the wheel by a random amount, again updating its displayed value.

For the second project, you'd like an app that loads a random selection of photos from the user's camera roll. The app should then display a queue of a certain number (let's call it X) of these photos at the bottom of the screen. When the user presses the button on the wheel, the background of the app should display the photo in the queue that corresponds to the current position of the button. For example, if X = 10 and the button has a value of 0 degrees, the first photo in the queue should be displayed. As the button's value changes, the background should update to show the corresponding photo. Every time the user presses the button, X should regenerate and a new selection of photos should be loaded.
